<h2>What is a genetic disorder?</h2>
<p>A genetic disorder is a genetic problem caused by one or more abnormalities in the genome, especially a condition that is present from birth (congenital). Most genetic disorders are quite rare and affect one person in every several thousands or millions.</p>
<p>Genetic disorders may be hereditary, passed down from the parents' genes. In other genetic disorders, defects may be caused by new mutations or changes to the DNA. In such cases, the defect will only be passed down if it occurs in the germ line. The same disease, such as some forms of cancer, may be caused by an inherited genetic condition in some people, by new mutations in other people, and mainly by environmental causes in other people. Whether, when and to what extent a person with the genetic defect or abnormality will actually suffer from the disease is almost always affected by the environmental factors and events in the person's development.</p>
<h2>What are the causes of genetic disorders?</h2>
<ul id="cause">
  <li>These are caused by changes in the structure or number of chromosomes or DNA.</li>
  <li>Genes encodes for proteins some of which, such as enzymes, carry out significant life functions. There are no genes that actually cause a disease. Changes in the genes called mutations, alter the structure function of the gene products which gives rise to diseases.</li>
  <li> A mutation in a single gene may result in a serious disorder like cystic fibrosis, achondroplasia or sickle cell anemia. </li>
  <li>Sometimes a mutation in the genes on the sex chromosomes results in a disorder. Mutations in certain X-linked genes result in specific diseases like Hemophilia, Muscular dystrophy and Fragile X syndrome.</li>
  <li>Some genetic conditions also occur as a result of the sex chromosomes being more or less in number. </li><li>A male has a X and a Y chromosome while the female has two XX. Sometimes a female has only a single X chromosome. This results in a Turner’s syndrome.Sometimes a male can have extra numbers of X chromosome causing Klinefelter syndrome in the affected individuals</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is a dominant genetic disease?</h2>
<p>Inheriting a disease, condition, or trait depends on the type of chromosome affected (autosomal or sex chromosome). It also depends on whether the trait is dominant or recessive. A single abnormal gene on one of the first 22 nonsex (autosomal) chromosomes from either parent can cause an autosomal disorder.</p>
<h2>How can mutations lead to genetic diseases?</h2>
<p>It is important to note that genes themselves do not cause disease—genetic disorders are caused by mutations that make a gene function improperly. For example, when people say that someone has “the cystic fibrosis gene,” they are usually referring to a mutated version of the CFTR gene, which causes the disease.</p>
<h2>How can gene mutations affect health and development?</h2>
<p>To function correctly, each cell depends on thousands of proteins to do their jobs in the right places at the right times. Sometimes, gene mutations prevent one or more of these proteins from working properly. By changing a gene’s instructions for making a protein, a mutation can cause the protein to malfunction or to be missing entirely. When a mutation alters a protein that plays a critical role in the body, it can disrupt normal development or cause a medical condition. A condition caused by mutations in one or more genes is called a genetic disorder.</p>
